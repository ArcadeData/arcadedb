# ArcadeDB v.26.8.1 Release Highlights

This is a living document: fixes, improvements, new features, and breaking changes are collected here as
they land during the 26.8.1 development cycle, so the release notes are ready at tag time.

### Fixes

#### Concurrent writes to unrelated records of the same page no longer conflict

ArcadeDB detects write conflicts per *page*, so two transactions that touched the same bucket page raised a
`ConcurrentModificationException` even when they wrote completely unrelated records that merely happened to
share it. On a type with few buckets and many concurrent writers this made a retry pointless: the retry ran
straight into the same collision ([#5279](https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues/5279)).

Both halves of that are gone in 26.8.1:

- **Inserts** into one page now reserve their slot per in-flight transaction, so concurrent inserts get
  different positions (and different RIDs) instead of all being handed the same one, and the commit-time
  disjoint-slot merge replays them on top of each other.
- **Updates** are replayed by that same merge whenever they stayed inside the page, which now includes a
  record that GREW - a longer string, one more property - and not only an overwrite of the same size or
  smaller. Growth is the normal update shape, so leaving it out kept concurrent updates of unrelated records
  conflicting for good.

Measured on the reported workload (one single bucket, `attempts=1`, no retry):

| Scenario | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Concurrent inserts | ~1750 conflicts / 2000 | 0 |
| Concurrent sub-graph creation (6 vertices + 5 edges per transaction) | ~270 / 320 | 0 |
| 10 transactions updating 10 different records of one page | 9 failed / 10 | 0 |
| Sustained updates, 8 writers on their own records of one page | ~2083 / 2880 | 0 |

A `ConcurrentModificationException` is still raised - by design - when two transactions really write the
**same** record: a byte-for-byte pre-image check makes sure no concurrent write is ever silently overwritten.
The same goes for the write shapes no merge can replay (a delete, a placeholder or multi-page record, a
record that has to spill out of its page). Nothing changes for single-writer workloads, and no application
change is needed. The merge can be switched off with `arcadedb.txPageSlotMerge=false`.

### New Features

#### Bloom filters on compacted LSM indexes (enabled by default)

An LSM index lookup walks every compacted series from newest to oldest. A series' root page already rules out
a key outside its key *range*, but not a key inside the range that the series simply does not hold - so that
series still costs a root-page search and a data-page read to discover nothing. Each compacted series now
carries a bloom filter that answers the question from a single 8 KB page.

The workload this is for is a bulk load into a **unique** index, where the duplicate check for every incoming
record misses in *every* series by definition
([#5517](https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues/5517), out of
[#5470](https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues/5470)).

Measured on 2M keys across 9 series (`LSMTreeBloomFilterBenchmark`, run with `-Dgroups=benchmark`):

| | filters off | filters on | |
|---|---|---|---|
| absent-key lookups (a duplicate check) | 199,743/s | 386,138/s | **1.9x** |
| pages read for those lookups | 1,490 | 705 | **2.1x fewer** |
| bytes read for those lookups | 372 MB | 176 MB | |
| present-key lookups | 244,000/s | 281,150/s | 1.2x |

- **On by default** at a 1% target false-positive rate: `arcadedb.indexBloomFilterRate=0.01`. Set it to `0`
  to switch the feature off entirely.
- **Costs about 1.2 bytes per key** on disk - roughly 3% of the index it describes - in a separate
  `<index>_bf.bfidx` component next to the compacted index. A false positive only costs the page read that
  would have happened anyway.
- **No rebuild and no migration.** Filters are written by compaction, so an existing index gains them at its
  next compaction. They replicate over HA and are included in backups like any other component, and are
  dropped with the index.
- **Helps most when compacted series overlap in key range**, which is what keys that do not arrive already
  sorted produce (an email, a UUID, a business id). Keys inserted in ascending order give each series a
  disjoint slice that its root page already rules out, leaving the filters little to save. Range scans and
  cursors never consult them: a filter can answer for one key, never for an interval.
- **Observability:** `bloomSkippedSeries` and `bloomProbedSeries` in the index statistics report how many
  series the filters spared and how many were still read.

Backward and forward compatible with no version bump and no rollout gate: an older ArcadeDB does not
recognise the `.bfidx` extension, never opens the file, and reads the index exactly as it does today. Note
that a downgraded build compacts *without* maintaining the filters, so if you downgrade and later come back,
prefer running a full compaction (or setting `arcadedb.indexBloomFilterRate=0`) on the upgraded build.
