ArcadeDB is a Multi-Model DBMS (created originally as a fork from OrientDB Open Source project after the acquisition by SAP) with
a brand new engine made of Alien Technology, able to crunch millions of records per second on common hardware with the usage of
minimal resources. ArcadeDB is written in LLJ: Low Level Java. It's still Java8+ but only using low level API to use advanced
mechanical sympathy techniques and a reduced pressure of the Garbage Collector.

ArcadeDB supports the following models:
- Graph Database (compatible with Gremlin and OrientDB SQL)
- Document Database (compatible with the MongoDB driver and MongoDB queries)
- Key/Value (compatible with the Redis driver)
- Time Series

ArcadeDB is compatible with Postgres Wire protocol, so you can use it from any language with the Postgres Driver and ArcadeDB SQL.
It supports also the Redis Protocol, MongoDB Protocol and Queries.

ArcadeDB is Free for any usage and licensed under the liberal Open Source Apache 2 license.

Have fun with data!
