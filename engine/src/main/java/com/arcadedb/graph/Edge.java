/**
 * An Edge represents the connection between two vertices in a Property Graph. The edge can have properties and point to the same vertex.
 * The direction of the edge goes from the source vertex to the destination vertex. By default edges are bidirectional, that means they can be traversed from
 * both sides. Unidirectional edges can only be traversed from the direction they were created, never backwards. Edges can be Immutable (read-only) and Mutable.
