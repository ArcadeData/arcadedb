/**
 * Native Query engine is a simple query engine that covers most of the classic use cases, such as the retrieval of records
 * with a where condition. It could be much faster than the same SQL query because it does not use any parser and it is very
 * JIT friendly. Future versions could translate the query into bytecode to have an even faster execution.
