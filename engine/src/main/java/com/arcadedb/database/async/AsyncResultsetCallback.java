 * Callback interface for asynchronous commands. If the command returns an exception, the {@link #onError(Exception)} method is invoked. Otherwise
 * {@link #onStart(ResultSet)} is called at first. The user can fetch the Resultset in this method. After the return from {@link #onStart(ResultSet)},
 * the result set is fetched and foreach result the method {@link #onNext(Result)} is invoked by passing the current Result object. When the fetching of the
 * result set is complete, the {@link #onComplete()} method is called.

 * It's suggested to extend the @{@link AbstractAsyncResultsetCallback} abstract class and implement {@link #onStart(ResultSet)} to fetch the result set all in
 * one call, otherwise implement {@link #onNext} method to be invoked foreach record in the result set. In case both {@link #onStart(ResultSet)} and
 * {@link #onNext(Result)} are implemented, whatever is remained left from fetching in the result set is invoked in multiple {@link #onNext(Result)} calls.
