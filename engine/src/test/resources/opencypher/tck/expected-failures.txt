# OpenCypher TCK Expected Failures
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# Each non-empty, non-comment line is a scenario name substring.
# Scenarios matching any pattern here will be skipped (via JUnit Assumptions).
# Remove entries as failures are fixed to ensure no regressions.

# ARCADEDB ARCHITECTURAL LIMITATIONS (Cannot be fixed without breaking changes)

# Case-insensitive type names - ArcadeDB follows SQL conventions
[2] Single-labels expression on relationships

# MISSING FEATURES (Complex features not yet implemented)

# VLP with pre-built relationship list (USING clause)
[8] Matching relationships into a list and matching variable length using the list

# TEMPORAL RANGE LIMITATIONS (Java LocalDateTime nanosecond precision limits: ~1677-2262)

# LocalDateTime sorting with year 1 and year 9999
[39] Sort by a local date time variable projected from a node property in ascending order
[40] Sort by a local date time variable projected from a node property in descending order

# DateTime sorting with year 1 and year 9999
[41] Sort by a date time variable projected from a node property in ascending order
[42] Sort by a date time variable projected from a node property in descending order

# LocalDateTime expression sorting with year 1 and year 9999
[17] Sort by a local date time expression in ascending order
[18] Sort by a local date time expression in descending order

# DateTime expression sorting with year 1 and year 9999
[19] Sort by a date time expression in ascending order
[20] Sort by a date time expression in descending order

# KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Planned for future implementation)

# ORDER BY with original expression after WITH aggregation (use aliases instead)
[22] Sort by an expression that is only partially orderable on a non-distinct binding table, but used as a grouping key
[23] Sort by an expression that is only partially orderable on a non-distinct binding table, but used in parts as a grouping key

# Cross-type comparison should return null for non-number types
[3] Comparing across types yields null, except numbers

# Complex quantifier filtering with temporal state
[3] Any quantifier is always true if the single or the all quantifier is true
